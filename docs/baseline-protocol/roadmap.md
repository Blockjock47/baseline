# Roadmap

## Community Bootstrapping Phase

Conduct orientations and alignment activities to ensure the community has -- and continues to have -- as close to a shared mental model about the nature, scope and priorities of the work possible.

Abstraction activity \#1: Refine and solidify the namespace

Abstraction activity \#2: Create a repeatable way to add Workflow Steps, such as Invoice, to Radish34 POC.

Generalization activity \#1: Develop and analyze canonical horizontal use cases \(e.g., B2B contracting, Regulatory Oversight on Trade, Audit, Trace\) against the abstracted Radish34 structures.
