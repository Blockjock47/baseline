# Roadmap

## Community Bootstrapping Phase \(March - June 2020\)

Conduct weekly orientation sessions and bi-weekly/monthly alignment activities to ensure the community has -- and continues to have -- as close to a shared mental model about the nature, scope and priorities of the work as possible.

Abstraction activity \#1: Refine and solidify the namespace

Abstraction activity \#2: Create a repeatable way to add Workflow Steps, such as Invoice, to Radish34 POC.

Generalization activity \#1: Develop and analyze canonical horizontal use cases \(e.g., B2B contracting, Regulatory Oversight on Trade, Audit, Trace\) against the abstracted Radish34 structures.

Generalization activity \#2: Develop and prioritize functional and non-functional specifications for the Baseline Protocol with context and justification from canonical horizontal use cases. Start with framework: e.g., performance within single action vs performance assuming many different concurrent actions by different organizations.

Take a Step Back: Look at the emerging protocol as a strawperson and tear it apart. What doesn't work? What are the risks? What blocks acceptable performance for the most basic, viral applications of the approach? AND then turn the problems into _problems to solve_.  

> If you want to turn problems into opportunities, always bring "two but's": "BUT that won't work...BUT it would if..."

This is a work in progress.
