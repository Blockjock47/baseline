# Open Source Community

The Baseline Protocol initiative was [announced](https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/ey-and-consensys-announce-formation-of-baseline-protocol-initiative-to-make-ethereum-mainnet-safe-and-effective-for-enterprises/) on March 4, 2020 and launched as an [OASIS](https://oasis-open-projects.org/) open source project on March 19, 2020, supported by fourteen founding companies. The initiative is strongly aligned with the Mainnet Working Group, a joint effort of the [Enterprise Ethereum Alliance](https://entethalliance.org) and the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org).

> This work is active and open to contributors.

All work in the [Baseline Protocol public repo](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis/baseline) is released under the CC0 1.0 Universal public domain dedication. For the full license text, refer to [`license.md`](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis/baseline/blob/master/license.md).

## Working Together

### Meetings and Meetups

Check the [**group calendar**](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/baseline/calendar) for times/dates of these online \(and eventually f2f\) meetings. If the times we have don't work for your timezone, we can do 1-1's or make changes to the schedule. Chime in on the [**Slack**](https://communityinviter.com/apps/ethereum-baseline/join-us)...don't be shy.

#### Onboarding: Help Getting Started

It's critical that new contributors have a good idea about what the focal points of the community are and where one can make a real impact. Hard to beat having a real conversation about how to get started in an intimate setting where you can ask questions and get immediate answers. ****

We will hold Onboarding office hours twice a week at least until June 2020. Sign up, or reach out on Slack to ask for 1-1 time. 

#### **Roadmapping**

There will be sessions \(online for now during the period of global pandemic\) to dive deep on the technology. Check the [calendar](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/baseline/calendar) for details.

### Connecting with Each Other Directly

#### Slack

The Baseline Protocol initiative maintains a Slack channel that is moderated but public. Sign up [**here**](https://communityinviter.com/apps/ethereum-baseline/join-us).  It's an active group, and you can directly connect with folks doing the work and coordinate with each other to get the work done.

#### Members Directory

You can [**sign up**](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/baseline) to the baseline protocol members list and get access to the [**Directory**](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/baseline/directory).

#### Group Email

When you [sign up](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/baseline) in the members directory, you will have the option to get email that's sent to the mailing list or directly from anyone in the group. You can control how that impacts your inbox [**here**](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/baseline/editsub). 

#### Forums

The team hasn't yet set up a Reddit or other public forum, but several new members are already talking about doing that. Stay tuned or help make it happen.

#### Social Networking

The Baseline Protocol initiative maintains the [@baselineproto](https://twitter.com/baselineproto) Twitter account, to which members of the TSC, SSC and some maintainers can post. We also use the [\#baselineprotoco](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Baselineprotocol)l tag.

#### Medium

The Baseline Protocol initiative will use Medium to post blogs.
