# Open Source Community

The Baseline Protocol initiative was [announced](https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/ey-and-consensys-announce-formation-of-baseline-protocol-initiative-to-make-ethereum-mainnet-safe-and-effective-for-enterprises/) on March 4, 2020 and launched as an [OASIS](https://oasis-open-projects.org/) open source project on March 19, 2020, supported by fourteen founding companies. The initiative is strongly aligned with the Mainnet Working Group, a joint effort of the [Enterprise Ethereum Alliance](https://entethalliance.org) and the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org).

> This work is active and open to contributors.

All work in the [Baseline Protocol public repo](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis/baseline) is released under the CC0 1.0 Universal public domain dedication. For the full license text, refer to [`license.md`](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis/baseline/blob/master/license.md).

## Working Together

### Meetings and Meetups

Check the [**group calendar**](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/baseline/calendar) for times/dates of these online \(and eventually f2f\) meetings. If the times we have don't work for your timezone, we can do 1-1's or make changes to the schedule. Chime in on the [**Slack**](https://communityinviter.com/apps/ethereum-baseline/join-us)...don't be shy.

#### Onboarding: Help Getting Started

It's critical that new contributors have a good idea about what the focal points of the community are and where one can make a real impact. Hard to beat having a real conversation about how to get started in an intimate setting where you can ask questions and get immediate answers. ****

We will hold Onboarding office hours twice a week at least until June 2020. Sign up, or reach out on Slack to ask for 1-1 time.
